# üîç The-State-of-Edge-AI 
A comprehensive survey on Edge AIÔºåcovering hardware, software, frameworks, applications, performance optimization, and the deployment of LLMs on edge devices.

## Why this Repo
Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI) is rapidly transforming the landscape of AI deployment, addressing the challenges posed by cloud-based solutions, such as high latency, privacy concerns, and significant bandwidth and computational resource requirements. As AI models grow in size and complexity, Edge AI becomes indispensable for processing data locally on devices like smartphones, IoT devices, and embedded systems. 

This repository provides a comprehensive exploration of Edge AI, offering insights into its hardware, software, frameworks, and applications, while also focusing on the performance optimization techniques and deployment of large AI models at the edge. By decentralizing AI processing, Edge AI facilitates real-time data analysis, enhances privacy, and optimizes the use of resources, making it a key enabler for the next generation of intelligent, scalable systems.
